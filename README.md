In this repos, 
I am going to mainly two different kind of visualization.
ECDF visualisation 
and hypothesis testing using the p-value. 

ECDF visualisation uses the iris dataset
for hypothesis testing, the dataset used are available in 
https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.g6g3h

The data has been processed and has only extracted only beak_depths
for 1975 and 2012 and is available in beak_depth_1975_2012.txt
